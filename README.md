# BITS CloudReady™ – Simulated Business Network on AWS
BITS CloudReady™ is a fully simulated business network I built on AWS to show exactly what I can create for my clients. Using secure VPC architecture, public and private subnets, compute, databases, IAM, monitoring, and failover, it’s a live example of how I deliver scalable, cost-optimized, and reliable cloud solutions through Brooks IT Services.

Project Overview

This project simulates the cloud migration of a fictional mid-sized company, using the same AWS patterns and best practices I apply for real clients.

Whether you’re moving your first workloads to the cloud or upgrading an existing setup, this environment shows exactly how I can help you:

* Host your public-facing applications and websites.

* Keep sensitive data in secure, private backend systems.

* Protect your business with security best practices and controlled access.

* Monitor performance and costs so your infrastructure stays healthy and efficient.

## Architecture

**Key Features I’ve Implemented:**
- Multi-tier **VPC architecture** with public/private subnets
- **Public-facing web tier** (S3 + CloudFront + Route 53)
- **Private compute tier** (EC2/Lambda)
- **Relational Database** (Amazon RDS) with encryption
- **Secure access controls** (IAM roles/policies, security groups)
- **Monitoring & logging** (CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs)
- **Failover** using Route 53 health checks
- **Cost optimization** with AWS Budgets and tagging


## AWS Services Used

| Service        | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Amazon VPC     | To isolate resources, control traffic flow, and securely connect services. |
| EC2 / Lambda   | To host backend services in a controlled, private environment. |
| S3 + CloudFront| To serve static website content quickly and securely around the world. |
| Amazon RDS     | To store and manage structured business data with encryption. |
| IAM            | To enforce least-privilege access for users and applications. |
| Route 53       | To manage DNS and enable automated failover. |
| CloudWatch     | To track performance, create alarms, and analyze logs. |
| AWS Budgets    | To keep cloud costs visible and under control. |
